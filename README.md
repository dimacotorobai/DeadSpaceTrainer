A trainer for the game Dead Space.
A trainer for the game Dead Space. Just a basic internal dll trainer for the game Dead Space which has the functions of GODMODE, AMMO, AIR, STASIS, ONESHOTKILL, add Credits, and add Nodes.

I just wanted to learn how the Windows API functions work as well as to apply my knowledge of operating systems and assembler.

The code for the hackProcess was taken from GuidedHacking while code for the window creation was taken from chilitomatonoodle(clever way of setting the windows procedure function as a method of the windows class).

Offsets were found using cheat engine.
